# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, RNN, and Random Forest #

This project demonstrates the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Random Forest models for stock price prediction. The models were developed and evaluated on historical stock price data, incorporating advanced feature engineering and preprocessing techniques to ensure robust predictions.

## Introduction ##

Accurate stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic and volatile nature of financial markets. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The project compares the performance of:

Random Forest: A traditional ensemble learning method.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Capable of processing sequential data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Designed to model long-term dependencies in time-series data.

The proposed LSTM model achieves the best performance by capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies in stock price data.
